However, some mail service providers such as Gmail, Yahoo!, Outlook might place the email in “SPAM” folder. Furthermore, it might also be possible that the mail has been blocked by any of the mentioned service providers. However, email containing PDF tickets may be delayed for technical reasons. Therefore, unavailability of the confirmation mail should not be regarded as non-issuance of ticket. If the reservation does not materialize and the client-passenger still wants to try for the same reservation once again, the process will be treated as a new reservation.

                        <p>To issue railway tickets, Customer centric railway system Portal depends on different payment getaways for the Card/Wallet charge information. Customer centric railway system does not store any sensitive information of Passengers such as Card/Wallet details, OTP, Pin Code. In case any Card/Wallet is charged and/or Payment Gateway fails to return the information in due time, it is possible that the passenger’s Card/Wallet would be charged without being issued for the desired tickets. In such instances, Payment Gateways will automatically refund the purchased amount by the Client-Passenger to their respective Card/Wallet within 8 (eight) working days. However, in case such a Client-Passenger does not receive refund within 8 (eight) working days, the client Client-Passenger is requested to send a complaint email to <a href="mailto:support@eticket.railway.gov.bd">support@eticket.railway.gov.bd</a> with details of the issue. A reply to such a Client-Passenger will be sent within 7 working days. Due to the dependency on payment service providers, it might take several days to resolve the issue. For a refund of unsuccessful purchases and card charging issues, Client-Passenger must contact the Payment Service Provider through which s/he made the transaction. For a refund of successfully purchased tickets, the Client-Passenger must visit their respective originating station (i.e., Departure Station from which the Client-Passenger will travel) and contact the refund counter. Customer centric railway system or Shohoz-Synesis-Vincen JV will not be held responsible for the non-issuance of tickets or delay of refund due to errors in payment processing or any other reasons that are beyond the control of Customer centric railway system or Shohoz-Synesis-Vincen JV. Customer centric railway system makes no guarantee/warranty that any of the above services will be uninterrupted, timely or error-free due to the dependencies on many Service Providers.</p>
                        <p>In case of any concerns or grievance against tickets purchased through the e-ticket website or Rail Sheba app, a passenger should notify Customer centric railway system within 2 hours by sending an email along with the e-ticket details to <a href="mailto:support@eticket.railway.gov.bd">support@eticket.railway.gov.bd</a>.</p>
                        <p>For any other grievance including tickets purchased from counters or any sort of inconvenience caused at stations or trains during their travel, passengers are requested to raise their complaints to Customer centric railway system through the concerned Travelling Ticket Examiner (“TT”).
